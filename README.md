# Tyre wear emission model based on friction

This repository contains the model code and model analyses conducted on the newly developed Tyre Wear emission model (Meesters and Quik, 2023).

This work was done as part of the LEON-T project and has reseived funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programma under gran agreement 955397.
