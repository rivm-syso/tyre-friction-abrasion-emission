### Wheelspin slip

#'Wheelspin slip [unitless or (m/s)/(m/s)] is caused by the difference in forward velocity between the vehicle and the wheels, 
#'i.e. the wheels turn faster than the vehicle drives forward.
#'The vehicle maneuvers are all assumed to be in the low slip regime.
#'As such, wheelspin slip is estimated to be linear proportional to the friction coefficient. 
#'The friction coefficient is estimated by dividing the normal load force (N) acting on the vehicle with the total longitudinal resistant forces (N).
#'However this friction coefficient is limited to a maximum. 
#'This peak friction coefficient is estimated from the wet tyre grip index and corrected for the track underground.
#'The optimal slip ratio is reached in case the friction coefficient equals the maximum friction coefficient
#'Optimal slip ratio is parameter that is given as a characteristic of the road surface
#'  
#'@section Friction coefficients per maneuver (unitless):
#'Friction coefficients are calculated by dividing the longitudinal friction forces with the normal load force acting on the tyres
#'The longitudinal friction forces differ for acceleration, constant speed and deceleration maneuvers, 
#'so that the friction coefficients differ for these maneuver as well.
#'The functions for the friction coefficients (mu) are therefore estimated separately for acceleration, deceleration and constant speed driving
