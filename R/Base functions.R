#### Slip Functions ####
#' Slip Functions
#' 
#' These functions are used to calculate slip. The functions include f_normal_load_force, 
#' f_mu_slip, f_mu_max, f_x_slip_long_force, f_slip_wheelspin, f_c_full_brake, 
#' f_slip_brake, f_mu_lat_slip and f_slip_lateral. 
#' 
### Slip caused by braking
# There are three scenarios in which the brakes are used, which are:
# i) the maximum brake test of the tyre, 
# ii) brake to decelerate 
# iii) brake to remain under speed limit at downhill slopes

## The slip [unitless or (m/s)/(m/s)] caused by braking is calculated
## by dividing the brake force needed to perform the maneuver with the maximum brake force the tyres can achieve

#'@section Brake slip during deceleration maneuvers
#' Brake slip during deceleration maneuvers is calculated by 
#' #'dividing the brake force needed upon the deceleration maneuver with the maximum brake force the tyres can achieve
#'

f_decel_brake_slip <- function (c_decel, m_vehicle, m_rotate, c_roll, grav_constant, rho_air, v_start_decel, v_end_decel, v_wind, alpha_slope, c_max_brake)
{pmin(1, (f_decel_brake_force(c_decel, m_vehicle, m_rotate, c_roll, grav_constant, rho_air, v_start_decel, v_end_decel, v_wind, alpha_slope) * 
            1/(f_max_brake_force(m_vehicle, m_rotate, c_max_brake)))) }

#'@section Brake slip during downhill constant speed driving
#' Brake slip during downhill constant speed driving is calculated by dividing the needed brake force to remain under speed limit with 
#' with the maximum brake force the tyres can achieve

f_downhill_brake_slip <- function (m_vehicle, grav_constant, alpha_slope, c_roll, c_drag, A_vehicle, rho_air, v_vehicle, v_wind, m_rotate, c_max_brake)
{pmin(1,(f_downhill_brake_force(m_vehicle, grav_constant, alpha_slope, c_roll, c_drag, A_vehicle, rho_air, v_vehicle, v_wind) * 
           1/ (f_max_brake_force(m_vehicle, m_rotate, c_max_brake))))}

### Wheelspin slip

#'Wheelspin slip [unitless or (m/s)/(m/s)] is caused by the difference in forward velocity between the vehicle and the wheels, 
#'i.e. the wheels turn faster than the vehicle drives forward.
#'The vehicle maneuvers are all assumed to be in the low slip regime.
#'As such, wheelspin slip is estimated to be linear proportional to the friction coefficient. 
#'The friction coefficient is estimated by dividing the normal load force (N) acting on the vehicle with the total longitudinal resistant forces (N).
#'However this friction coefficient is limited to a maximum. 
#'This peak friction coefficient is estimated from the wet tyre grip index and corrected for the track underground.
#'The optimal slip ratio is reached in case the friction coefficient equals the maximum friction coefficient
#'Optimal slip ratio is parameter that is given as a characteristic of the road surface
#'  
#'@section Friction coefficients per maneuver (unitless):
#'Friction coefficients are calculated by dividing the longitudinal friction forces with the normal load force acting on the tyres
#'The longitudinal friction forces differ for acceleration, constant speed and deceleration maneuvers, 
#'so that the friction coefficients differ for these maneuver as well.
#'The functions for the friction coefficients (mu) are therefore estimated separately for acceleration, deceleration and constant speed driving

#'@section Peak friction coefficient (unitless):
#'The peak friction coefficient (mu_max_tyre) is considered to be a characteristic of the tyres. 
#'On wet asphalt the peak friction coefficient(wet_mu_max_tyre) can be derived from the wet grip index number 
#'and the peak friction coefficient at wet asphalt of a reference tyre (wet_mu_max_ref_tyre) which has a value of 0.85.
