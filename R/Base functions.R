#### Longitudinal friction force Functions

#'@section Aerodynamic drag force
#Aerodynamic drag force is defined as the force which is faced by the vehicle as it moves through the air.
#The aerodynamic drag force is present during acceleration, deceleration and constant speed maneuvers.
#It is calculated from the density of air (rho_air), the velocity of the wind (v_wind) and vehicle (v_vehicle) 
#as well as the vehicles drag coefficient (c_drag) and the vehicle frontal area (A_vehicle).

f_drag_force <- function(c_drag, A_vehicle, rho_air, v_vehicle, v_wind) {pmax(0,c_drag*A_vehicle*rho_air*(((v_vehicle)+v_wind)^2)/2)}

#'@section Roll resistance force
# Rolling resistance force (F_roll) is defined as the force that resists the motion the tyres rolling on the track surface.
# The rolling resistance force is present during acceleration, deceleration and constant speed maneuvers.
# It is calculated as the product of the roll resistance coefficient (c_roll) defined for the tyre-track interface, 
# the vehicles mass (m_vehicle) and the gravitational acceleration constant (grav_constant).

f_roll_force <- function(c_roll, m_vehicle, grav_constant) {c_roll*m_vehicle*grav_constant}

#'@section Slope force
# The slope force (also called grade force) refers to the in- or declination of the surface road to the horizontal in longitudinal direction.
# The slope force (F_slope) is calculated as the product of the vehicle mass (m_vehicle), the gravitational constant (grav_constant) 
# and the sinus of the slope angle of the road (alpha_slope) in degrees.
# As such, slope force is zero in case there is no road in- or declination (alpha_slope = 0).
# It is included as a longitudinal resistant longitudinal force in case the road inclines (alpha_slope > 0) and the vehicle thus drives 
# in uphill direction. The slope force is as such present as resistant longitudinal force during upon uphill driving acceleration, deceleration 
# and constant speed maneuvers. In case the road declines (alpha_slope < 0) the slope force is considered a propulsive force that 
# does not yield friction at the tyres. 
# However, at steep hills and low speed limits, the driver may need to use the brakes to decelerate or to keep a constant speed under the speed limit.
# In that case slope force is included in the calculation of the level of brake force that is needed for deceleration and constant speed maneuvers.

f_slope_force <- function(m_vehicle, grav_constant, alpha_slope) {
  m_vehicle * grav_constant * sin(alpha_slope)
}

#'@section Brake force
#'Brake force (F_brake) is the force acting on the tyres as the driver uses the brakes of the vehicle.
#'The calculation of the level of brake force needed strongly depends on the maneuver the performed.
#'In case of a deceleration maneuver the brake force needed is calculated from the deceleration constant of the performed maneuver (c_decel),
#'the other resistant forces that also slow the vehicle down, e.g. aerodynamic drag force, rolling resistance force and inclining slope force,
#'the mass of the vehicle and the mass of the rotating parts of the vehicle.
#'The minimum brake force is limited to zero.
#'The slope force is negative at downhill driving, so that more brake force is needed to compensate downhill slope force as a propulsive.

#'@section Inertia force 
# Inertia force lets bodies remain in their state, either at rest or in motion.
# The direction of inertia opposes the change of the speed.
# As such it acts as a resistive force for an accelerating vehicle and as a tractive force for a decelerating vehicle.
# The vehicle thus needs to overcome an inertia force during acceleration, 
# which is calculated as the sum of the vehicle mass and rotating parts multiplied by the acceleration constant the driver performs.

#'@section Longitudinal slip functions
#' Longitudinal slip is defined here as the difference between the actual forward vehicle velocity and 
#' the radiant velocity of the wheels.The model includes two type of slip activities which are: 
#' (i) wheelspin: the wheel velocity is faster than the forward velocity of the vehicle but slips due to a lack of traction 
#' and (ii) braking: vehicle is still moving in forward direction but a brake force limits the wheel velocity.

#'@section Wheelspin slip
#'The peak friction coefficient (mu_max_tyre_track) is defined here as the measure of tyre to road surface friction based on the maximum deceleration of a rolling tyre.
#'As such, the peak friction coefficient can differ for each combination of tyre as well as the type, wettiness and temperature of the road surface. 
#'Measurement data on the peak friction coefficient are available for the specific circuit test runs performed at IDIADA.
#'In case, such measurement data is not available the peak friction coefficient for wet asphalt can be estimated 
#'from the tyres's wet grip index as indicated by the EU quality label 
#'and the peak friction coefficient of a reference tyre in EU testing protocols (wet_mu_max_ref_tyre) which has a value of 0.85.
#' For other undergrounds then wet asphalt the peak friction coefficient can be calculated using a correction factor.
